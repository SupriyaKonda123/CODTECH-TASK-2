Overview of the Project

Project:Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Stock Market Analysis and Prediction 

Objective:

Analyze Stock Market Data: The primary objective of this project is to analyze historical stock market data to identify trends and patterns.
Time Series Prediction: Use machine learning models to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
Data Visualization: Visualize the trends and predictions to better understand the market dynamics.

Key Activities:

Data Collection: Historical stock data was collected, cleaned, and preprocessed.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various statistical methods were employed to understand the dataset's characteristics, including visualizations.
Model Training: Machine learning models, particularly time series models, were trained to predict future stock prices.
Model Evaluation: The accuracy of the models was evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualization of predicted vs. actual prices.
Visualization: Data was visualized at various stages to provide insights into the stock market trends and model predictions.

 Technology Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: 
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning model training and evaluation.
Jupyter Notebook: Used as the environment to develop, test, and document the analysis.

 Key Insights

Market Trends: Identified specific trends and patterns in the stock market that could be used for trading strategies.
Prediction Accuracy: The trained models provided a reasonable prediction of stock prices, though improvements could be made.
Model Limitations: Certain limitations were identified, such as the sensitivity to market volatility, which impacts the prediction accuracy.
