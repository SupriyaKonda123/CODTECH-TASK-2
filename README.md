Overview of the Project

Project:Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Stock Market Analysis and Prediction 

Objective:

This project provides tools for stock market analysis and prediction, leveraging both fundamental and 
technical analysis techniques. It includes data-driven models to forecast future stock prices and trends. The repository is designed to assist investors in making informed decisions.

Key Activities:
Key activities of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Stock Market Analysis and Prediction include:


1. Data Collection:
   - Gathering historical stock prices, financial statements, and market indices from APIs, databases, or CSV files.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Cleaning, normalizing, and transforming data to ensure itâ€™s suitable for analysis and modeling.
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and data scaling.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualizing trends, patterns, and correlations in the stock market data using charts and statistical summaries.
   - Identifying key indicators and factors influencing stock prices.

4. Prediction and Forecasting:
   - Using trained models to predict future stock prices or market trends.
   - Implementing time series forecasting techniques like ARIMA, Prophet, or RNNs.

5. Visualization and Reporting:
    - Creating dashboards, plots, and reports to present analysis results and predictions to stakeholders.

Technologies used:
. Python:The primary programming language for data analysis.
. panadas:used for data manipulation and analysis
. matplotlib:Employed for creating static,animated and interactive visulaizations
. seaborn:utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and interactive and attractive.

Key insights:

1. Data Preprocessing: Effective data preprocessing is crucial for accurate analysis and prediction. The notebook involves steps like loading data, checking its structure, and visualizing basic trends.

2. Stock Market Analysis: The analysis focuses on individual stocks like Tesla and Microsoft, exploring their historical prices, cumulative returns, and autocorrelation.

3. Time Series Prediction with ARIMA: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is used to predict future stock prices based on past data. The model is trained and tested on historical data to evaluate its performance.

4. Visualization: The notebook includes various plots (e.g., cumulative returns, autocorrelation, and price prediction) to visually analyze stock performance and model predictions.

5.Model Evaluation*: The performance of the ARIMA model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE), providing insights into prediction accuracy.
